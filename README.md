# 📊 Job Application Tracker Dashboard

## 🧠 Problem
Tracking job applications manually can be messy and makes it hard to identify patterns or measure success.  
I wanted to analyze my own job search data to improve my strategy and showcase my Power BI skills.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Excel (data entry & cleaning)
- Power Query (ETL process)
- Power BI Desktop (dashboard & KPIs)
- DAX (calculated metrics)

## 🔎 Process
1. Created a dataset of 330 job applications with fields (date, company, site, role, status).
2. Cleaned data (consistent categories, removed duplicates).
3. Designed KPIs:  
   - % Applications Viewed  
   - Avg. Response Time  
   - Platform Success Rate
4. Built interactive visuals with slicers (status, site, date), but there are no link for published work since I use this for my personal project

## 📈 Results
- Identified LinkedIn as the platform with the highest response rate.
- Found that applying within the first 48 hours increased chances of being viewed.
- Dashboard made it easier to track progress and refine strategy.
